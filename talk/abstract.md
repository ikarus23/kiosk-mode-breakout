## Titel
Prison Break - Kiosk Mode Environments

## Duration
45 to 60 minutes

## Abstract
You probably have been into this situation. You stand in front of a terminal to get a ticket for public transport.
Or it might have been to order food in a modern restaurant. Maybe you just have used the info terminal in tourist
information or museum. Or you are a doctor configuring a medical device.

Systems running a tailored user experience in a kiosk mode environment can be found pretty much everywhere. But
what if you do not paly by the rules? Did you ever wonder what would happen if you press all the buttons? Plug in
an unauthorized device? Can you get access to the underlying operating system? Can you compromise the device?

This talk tries to be a collection of tips & tricks on how to break out of a kiosk mode. I'm sure a lot of
people have stories to share on how they bypassed a kiosk mode environment and I want to share mine. There will
be knowledge, anecdotes, demos and hopefully some time to hear from your ideas on how to break out!
